        <h2>HISTORY OF C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h2><br>

        <h4>Evolution of C programming language</h4><br>

C has often been termed as a "Pseudo high level language" or a "Middle level language" by many programmers. This 
is not because of its lack of programming power but because of its capability to access the system's low level 
functions. In fact C was invented specifically to implement UNIX. C instructions are compiled to assembly code 
therefore, depending on the complexity of the code and on the compiler optimization capabilities, C code may run 
as fast as assemby. Ken Thompson created the B language in 1969 from Martin Richard's BCPL (Basic Combined 
Programming Language). He used assembly language andB to produce the initial versions of the UNIX operating 
system. BCPL and B were typeless languages in which variables were simply words inmemory. Dennis Ritchie of Bell 
Laboratories later converted B into C by retaining most of B's syntax in 1972 and wrote the first compiler. This 
was implemented on DEC's PDP 11 and it was first used as the system's language for rewriting the UNIX operating 
system. Later on, UNIX, its tools and C grew simultaneously. In 1978, Kernighan and Ritchie wrote a book entitled
'The C Programming Language' that became the language definition for almost a decade. Beginning in 1983, the ANSI 
X3J11 committee was asked to standardize the C language. The result was ANSI C, a standard which was adopted in 
1988. It is not forced upon any programmer, but since it is so widely accepted, it would be economically unwise 
for any systems programmer or compiler writer not to conform to the standard
